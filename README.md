# Basic-Interactive-Solar-System
Interactive Visualization HW4

This interactive solar system was developed from scratch. I used the D3 documentation and
Stack Overflow discussions to understand and implement the visual elements like planetary
orbits, image placements, and interactive tooltips. Given more time, I would enrich the pop-up
windows with more detailed, planet-specific facts and personalize the background to reflect the
planet.

Instructions for Use/Demo:
- Hover over any planet to see a tooltip with the planet's name.
- Click on a planet to display an information panel or pop-up with facts about the planet.
